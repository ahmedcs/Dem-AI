# Towards Distributed and Decentralized Learning

We are working for the demonstration of some properties and new algorithm for Democratized Learning in
 
"Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges"

https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301


This code is forked and reimplemented based on our prior paper and FedProx code:

"Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Convergence Analysis and Resource Allocation"

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13067

FedProx implementation as: https://github.com/litian96/FedProx
