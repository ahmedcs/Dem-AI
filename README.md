# Self-organizing Democratized Learning: Towards Large-scale Distributed Learning Systems

We are working for the demonstration of some properties and initially develop new algorithm for Democratized Learning systems based on our Dem-AI philosophy paper
 
"Distributed and Democratized Learning: Philosophy and Research Challenges", [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09301)


This code is forked and reimplemented based on our prior paper and FedProx code:

"Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Convergence Analysis and Resource Allocation"
[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13067)

FedProx implementation as: https://github.com/litian96/FedProx
